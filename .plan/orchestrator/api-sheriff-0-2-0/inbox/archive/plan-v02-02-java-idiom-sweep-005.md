# A review bot's "will not compile" verdict is refuted by the pinned version's own green build

On PR #198 CodeRabbit filed a **Critical / Functional Correctness** finding claiming
that `MemorySize.of(long)` does not exist and that the call sites "will fail to
compile". The finding arrived with an analysis chain: a repo script, a web query, and
citations — the presentation of a verified claim.

It was wrong, and cheaply so. Four jobs on that exact PR head (`build (25)`,
`build (26)`, `sonar-build`, `integration-tests / test`) were green, and the `verify`
lifecycle compiles test sources. Code sitting under four green compile jobs cannot fail
to compile. The bot's chain reached the opposite conclusion because every Javadoc it
consulted was **pre-overhaul** — `quarkus-core` 3.6.4 and 1.0.0.CR1 — while the project
pins 3.38.1, where the static factory arrived with the `MemorySize` rework
(quarkusio/quarkus#54783). The same chain cited that PR without connecting it to the
API-surface question it was answering.

## Rule

When a review bot asserts that code **does not compile**, **does not resolve**, or
**does not exist**, the cheapest and most authoritative refutation is the build already
attached to the reviewed commit — check CI status on the reviewed SHA before opening
the API question at all. A green compile job over the exact head is a first-party
observation; a bot's version-grounded citation is not, and is only as current as the
docs it happened to fetch.

Corollary for API-existence claims specifically: confirm which **version** the cited
documentation describes. A confident citation of a *stale* version reads identically to
a citation of the pinned one.

## Provenance

First-party from `plan-v02-02-java-idiom-sweep` / PR #198. The finding was declined with
the refutation recorded on the thread; both call sites were left unchanged and the merge
was clean.
