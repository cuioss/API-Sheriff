# Prove a "pre-existing" failure by reproducing it on the base, not by arguing from the diff

## What happened

The merge queue's re-test of PR #382 failed once (PipelineVerbIT.putIsForwarded, NoHttpResponseException after 60s). The branch-cleanup queue-landing gate first classified it "environmental, not branch-caused" from provenance (passed in PR CI and locally). A later investigation found `IllegalStateException: Response already ended` in the gateway relay and reclassified it as a "pre-existing timing race" because `git diff base..head -- api-sheriff/` was empty. The operator challenged the "pre-existing" assumption. TASK-8 then wrote a deterministic race test (DispatchStageTest.relaysTinyBodyThatOutranTheDispatchingThread) and ran it against UNMODIFIED production code: it failed with the same exception, which proved both pre-existence and the mechanism (the pause was attached by a listener registered too late on the composed future, so the body was dropped before the pause took effect).

## Rule

An empty diff over the failing component, or a green history elsewhere, is evidence of plausibility, not proof. Before recording a failure as pre-existing or environmental, reproduce it against the base tree — ideally with a deterministic test that fails on base and passes with the fix. Record the fails-before evidence in the decision log.

## Why it matters

The first two classifications would have re-enqueued a branch over a real defect. Only the reproduction on base turned a rerun into a fix.
