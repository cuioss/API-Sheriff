# Candidate lesson (handed off from `deployment-configurability`'s local corpus): An either-a-comment-or-the-adjacent-doc fork is not a real option when the target file is strict JSON

Original lesson `2026-09-23-07-004` (component `api-sheriff`).

## What happened

PLAN-28 deliverable 7 offered the executing agent a choice: record the `re_review_on_loopback`
rationale "in a comment or the adjacent doc". `.plan/marshal.json` is strict JSON and admits no
comment syntax, so exactly one of the two offered branches was implementable — the request itself
contained an unimplementable option, and nothing in the request said so. Refine also surfaced that
the adjacent `re_review_on_branch_cleanup` is already `true`, so re-review does occur at branch
cleanup; a rationale written without that fact would have been misleading.

## Candidate rule

Offering a fork in a deliverable is normal and good. The defect class is offering a fork whose arms
were never checked against the format of the file they land in — this generalizes past JSON to a
`.properties` file read by a strict parser, a YAML anchor block, or a generated file a later
regeneration overwrites. A deliverable that offers "record this as a comment OR in the adjacent doc"
must have each arm validated against the target file's format and regeneration story before the fork
ships; where one arm is impossible, drop it in the outline.

## Source

`deployment-configurability` PLAN-28 (PR #341), Q-Gate finding `f3e1d0` (phase 2-refine, resolution
`taken_into_account`). Disposition: operator ruled to keep `re_review_on_loopback: false` and record
the rationale in an adjacent doc; landed as `doc/development/re-review-on-loopback.adoc`.
