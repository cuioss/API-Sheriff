# Deep-lane plan reached the outline Q-Gate with an empty assessment store

## Observation

`status.metadata.planning_lane` was `deep` for PLAN-16, so an assessment pass was
expected to have populated the component-assessment store. It had not:
`manage-findings assessment list --certainty CERTAIN_INCLUDE` returned
`total_count: 0`. Outline validator 2.2 (Assessment Coverage) compares each
deliverable's `affected_files` against that set, so with an empty set the
validator had **zero discriminating power** — applying its literal predicate would
have flagged all 8 affected files as unassessed, which is the signature of a
producer that never ran rather than 8 individual scope errors.

Emitting those 8 findings was correctly declined as a false-positive class, and
the affected-file set was independently corroborated by direct reads. But the
consequence is that the gate reported green over coverage it never actually had,
and validator step 5 (missing-coverage) was vacuously clean for the same reason.

## Rule

A validator whose comparison set is empty must report *which kind of zero* it is —
"the producer never ran" is not "everything is covered". A gate that silently
degrades to vacuous-pass on a missing producer is worse than one that reports the
coverage gap, because it is indistinguishable from a real green.

## Disposition in this run

Recorded as an explicit accepted coverage gap (Q-Gate `a12e6b`, `accepted`), as the
validator itself offered. The residual is the mechanism question the epic should
carry: on a `deep` lane, either the assessment producer should be guaranteed to
have run before validator 2.2 consults its store, or the validator should fail
loudly on an empty store rather than offering an accept-the-gap path.
