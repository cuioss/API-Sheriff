# Outline replaced a rule of ADR-0057 without listing the ADR

Source: quality-check finding d5c171 (outline phase, resolved in the run).

What happened: ADR-0057 decides that a widening of a session keeps the session identity. The first outline of deliverable 5 gave the session a new id on step-up and widening, which is the opposite, and no deliverable listed ADR-0057. It was closed by keeping the session identity as the ADR decides and re-issuing only the browser-facing cookie value in server mode; ADR-0057 joined the documentation deliverable with one amended paragraph that names identity and cookie value separately.

Candidate rule: An outline that names an identifier (session id, cookie value, handle) must say which of them changes and which stays, and check that wording against the ADRs that use the same words. "The session gets a new id" and "the cookie gets a new value" are different decisions.
