# Candidate lesson: `ci checks pull-request-runs` reported zero runs while the PR's runs were starting

**Source signal:** orchestrator observation during finalize (automatic-review round 2, then the pre-merge barrier)
**Component (suggested):** plan-marshall:tools-integration-ci / plan-marshall:workflow-integration-github (pull_request_runs)
**Category (suggested):** bug

## What happened

- During automatic-review round 2, `ci checks pull-request-runs` returned `run_count: 0`.
- A few minutes later, at the pre-merge barrier, the same query returned 32 runs with `has_pull_request_run: true`.

## Why it matters

A consumer that reads `run_count: 0` as "CI was not triggered" (the not_triggered observable) can take the wrong branch while runs are only queued or not yet visible to the API.

## Suggested direction

Treat a zero shortly after a push as "not yet observed", not as a verdict. Re-poll within a bounded window, or tie the answer to the head sha and the push time, before reporting not_triggered.
