# Candidate lesson: a self-review author excused a stale ordinal by citing a numbering that does not exist

**Source signal:** Q-Gate findings 7cb57f and 0f5047 (6-finalize, both fixed)
**Component (suggested):** pm-plugin-development:ext-self-review-plan-marshall / plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize (pre-submission self-review)
**Category (suggested):** anti-pattern
**Related existing lesson:** 2026-10-04-09-001 ("Prove a 'pre-existing' failure by reproducing it on the base, not by arguing from the diff")

## What happened

- TopologyResolver.java lines 50 and 79 called the topology resolver pipeline "step 6". This plan touched line 79 (throwing -> failing). The new ConfigBootPipeline Javadoc numbers the boot pipeline 1-5, with topology at 3.
- The self-review author left "step 6" in place and said it followed an external numbering. No such numbering exists anywhere in the repository.
- The independent verifier refused the verdict (`verdict_refused`) because the adjudication had no support. The ordinal was replaced with a content anchor in commit 6c5208d1, and the round-2 verifier accepted.

## Rule

Before calling a touched claim "pre-existing" or "external", cite the place where that numbering or source is defined. If you cannot point to it, fix the claim. Prefer content anchors ("the topology stage") over ordinals that drift.

## What worked

The independent verifier step caught it. This supports keeping the verifier separate from the author.
