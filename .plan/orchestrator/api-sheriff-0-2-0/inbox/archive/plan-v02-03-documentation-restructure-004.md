title=asciidoc verify-links does not parse link: macros, so its green result is not link coverage

# `asciidoc verify-links` does not parse `link:` macros, so its green result is not link coverage

`asciidoc verify-links` reported **0 broken links** across the documentation tree while **13
relocated-section pointers were dangling**. The dangling pointers were found by hand, not by the
verifier.

## Why

The verifier parses `xref:` and `<<...>>` cross-reference forms only. AsciiDoc's `link:` macro —
the form this project uses for most inter-document pointers — is not parsed at all, so every
`link:` target is silently outside the checked set.

## Why it is a defect and not a limitation

The verb reports `0 broken links` with no statement of what it did not look at. A caller reading
that output concludes the tree's links are verified. It is the same false-negative shape as
`architecture search` over YAML: a clean-looking zero that is wrong, and whose wrongness is
invisible at the call site.

## What the mechanism should do instead

Either parse `link:` macros, or report the unchecked macro class explicitly so a green result
carries its own scope. A verifier that cannot see a link form must say so rather than count it as
verified.

## Consequence for callers today

A green `verify-links` run is **not** evidence for documentation that uses `link:` macros. Where
link integrity matters, the `link:` targets must be checked separately until the verb covers them.

## Evidence

Plan `plan-v02-03-documentation-restructure` (epic `api-sheriff-0-2-0`), PR #197. 13 dangling
`link:` pointers introduced by the D2 section relocation; `verify-links` green throughout.
