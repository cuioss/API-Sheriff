title=Builds dispatched from inside a plan are attributed to NO_PLAN in the daemon audit path

# Builds dispatched from inside a plan are attributed to `NO_PLAN` in the daemon audit path

Every build this plan routed through the marshalld build server was submitted with
`plan=NO_PLAN` rather than the plan id, despite running inside an active plan's phase-5/phase-6
envelope.

## Consequence

The daemon's per-project interaction-audit log cannot attribute a build to the plan that caused
it. Per-plan build attribution — how many builds a plan consumed, which plan's build held the
queue, which plan's build was the one killed — is simply absent from the audit path, and the
absence is silent: `NO_PLAN` is a legitimate value for a genuinely plan-less ad-hoc build, so the
misattributed rows are indistinguishable from correct ones.

## What the mechanism should do instead

The plan id is available in the dispatch envelope (`plan_id` is a required prompt-body field on
every `execution-context` dispatch) and every `manage-*` call in the same envelope forwards it. The
build submission should forward the same value, and the `NO_PLAN` sentinel should be reserved for
submissions that genuinely have no plan context.

## Evidence

Plan `plan-v02-03-documentation-restructure` (epic `api-sheriff-0-2-0`), PR #197. All builds in the
plan's `build-results` show `plan=NO_PLAN`.
