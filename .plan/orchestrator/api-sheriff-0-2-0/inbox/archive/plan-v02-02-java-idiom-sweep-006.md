# Eight argparse rejections across six notations in one run — the codified rule did not bind

`persona-plan-marshall-agent` already carries a hard rule ("Never invent script
subcommands") that enumerates the exact recurrence signatures below. The rule was
loaded in this run. It still produced **eight `exit_code: 2` argparse rejections across
six distinct notations**, which is the datum worth recording: the failure is not that
the rule is missing, it is that a loaded prose rule does not bind at call-construction
time.

## The observed rejections (first-party, from this plan's work log)

Verb-paraphrase (invented a plausible verb):

- `manage-references` — `invalid choice: 'get-list'` (real verbs include `get`, `set-list`, `add-list`)
- `manage-solution-outline` — `invalid choice: 'extract-deliverables'` (real verb: `list-deliverables`)

Verb-scoped flag that does not exist on that parser:

- `architecture` — `unrecognized arguments: --plan-id ...`
- `manage-status` — `unrecognized arguments: --reason-...`
- `ci` — `unrecognized arguments: --issue 178` at the TOP level (the flag is real, but only under `ci issue ...`)

Required flag dropped from an otherwise well-formed call:

- `manage-execution-manifest step-params set` — `required: --param`
- `github_pr fetch_findings` — `required: --pr-number`
- `ci issue comment` — `required: --issue`

The third group is the interesting one and is **not** the same defect as the first two.
There the verb and the flag vocabulary were both correct; a required, value-bearing flag
simply was not present in the emitted argv. Note the adjacency in the log: `ci --issue 178`
(flag at the wrong level) is followed shortly by `ci issue comment` (right level) with
`--issue` now **absent**. The correction moved the flag and lost it. This run does not
establish the mechanism behind that loss, so it is reported as an observation, not
diagnosed.

## Rule

- Before emitting a `manage-*` / tool call whose verb or flag set is not already on
  screen in this session, read the skill's `## Canonical invocations` block or invoke
  `--help`. Reconstructing the surface from surrounding workflow prose is what produces
  the verb-paraphrase and wrong-level-flag classes above.
- After *correcting* a rejected call, re-read the whole corrected argv against the usage
  line rather than only the segment that was wrong. Three of the eight rejections here
  are second attempts that fixed one defect and introduced another.

## Provenance

`plan-v02-02-java-idiom-sweep`, work log 2026-08-08T21:04Z through 2026-08-09T04:13Z.
Every rejection above is quoted from a `[ERROR] ... script_failure ... failure_kind=argparse_rejection`
line in that log. None of them blocked the plan; all were retried successfully.
