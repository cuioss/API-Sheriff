# Candidate lesson: the queue-landing wait is shorter than the queue's own re-test, and its fallback draws on a budget other steps have already spent

## Pattern

Two settings interact badly on this repository.

1. The merge queue re-runs the full check suite on the queued change. That run takes about as long as a normal CI run here, roughly half an hour. The branch-cleanup step waits 1800 s for the queued change to land. The wait therefore expires at about the moment the queue finishes, and a perfectly healthy merge is reported as "not landed".
2. The documented recovery for an expired landing wait is a loop-back. Loop-backs are counted against one ceiling for the whole finalize phase. Any step that loops earlier (here the self-review, five times) leaves nothing for the steps that come later, although their need is unrelated.

The result was a finalize that had done everything correctly, with the change enqueued at position 1, and still could not finish on its own.

## What the record shows

- CI on the pull request took about 29 minutes per run (ci-verify 16:14Z to 16:43Z; again completing at 18:30Z after a start near 17:58Z).
- Enqueue at 18:43:38Z (decision log 0ea9fa). Landing gate at 19:14:54Z: "enqueued but not merged after 1800s (terminal observation: state=open at 1803s)", post-merge tail skipped (work log 687826).
- The step ended `loop_back`; the dispatcher refused it: "requested iteration 6 against a ceiling of 5" (work log 55175b). The refused loop-back carried no review work: 0 pending findings, 0 pending tasks (decision log 344c04).
- At 19:21:57Z, seven minutes after the wait expired, the change was observed merged by the platform queue (work log 778ad3). Cleanup then had to be resumed by a fresh finalize entry on the already-merged path (decision log 9bc360, 0efbe1).
- The same spent ceiling had already forced two operator decisions earlier in this finalize: the re-integration after the base moved (795744) and the review-bot refusal (1d9dad). In all three cases the ceiling was spent by the self-review loop alone (work log 9a64ed).

## How to recognise it next time

- `use_merge_queue=true` and the repository's CI run is 25 minutes or longer.
- `loop_back_iteration` already equals the ceiling when the wait region or branch-cleanup is entered.
- The landing gate reports `state=open` with the change still at the head of the queue, and no check has failed.

## Suggested direction (for the orchestrator to classify)

- Size the queue-landing wait from the observed CI duration with headroom (twice the last green run would have been enough here), or make it a per-project setting.
- An expired landing wait with the change still queued and no failed check is a wait, not a rework; it should not consume, or be blocked by, the review loop-back ceiling. Re-polling the queue state is the whole remedy.
- More generally, count loop-backs per step or per cause, so that a non-converging review cannot exhaust the budget of the merge mechanics.
- Until that changes: when the ceiling is already spent on entry to branch-cleanup, expect the landing gate to expire and plan the fresh finalize entry instead of treating it as a failure.
