# A constant-only switch STATEMENT is a legacy switch and is NOT exhaustiveness-checked

During `plan-v02-02-java-idiom-sweep` the plan removed a trailing `throw` from an
authentication path, on the premise that a `switch` whose labels already cover every
enum constant is exhaustiveness-checked by `javac` and therefore cannot fall through.

That premise is false for the shape that was actually there. A `switch` **statement**
whose labels are all constant case labels is a *legacy* switch: `javac` applies no
exhaustiveness requirement to it, and a value outside the labelled set (including
`null`, which a legacy switch answers with an NPE only for the selector, not for a
missing arm) falls straight through the statement. Removing the trailing `throw` on
the strength of a compiler guarantee that does not exist converted a fail-closed
authentication decision into a **fail-open** one.

Exhaustiveness is enforced only for a switch that is an *enhanced* switch — one using
pattern labels, a `case null` label, or appearing in expression position. Adding a
`case null -> throw ...` arm is what promoted the construct to an enhanced switch and
restored the check; that is the fix that shipped.

## Rule

Before deleting a default/trailing `throw` from a switch on the argument that "the
compiler proves this is unreachable", establish that the switch is an **enhanced**
switch. A constant-only `switch (x) { case A: ...; case B: ...; }` statement is not,
whatever its labels cover. On an authorization or authentication path, treat the
trailing throw as load-bearing until the enhanced-switch form is demonstrated.

## Provenance

Caught by the plan's own pre-submission self-review, before the PR was opened —
not by the build, not by a review bot, and not by any test. The JVM quality gate and
the full `verify` were both green over the fail-open version.
