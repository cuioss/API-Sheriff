# Argparse-rejection cluster in one run, led by top-level --plan-id on a verb-scoped surface

## Observation

Five `script_failure` markers fired across this single plan run; four were argparse
or contract rejections that cost a round trip each:

| When | Notation | exit | Shape |
|------|----------|:----:|-------|
| 11:37 | `plan-marshall:manage-solution-outline` | 2 | refused: `use_worktree=true` but `worktree_path` empty |
| 11:41 | `plan-marshall:manage-references` | 2 | `unrecognized arguments` |
| 12:13 | `plan-marshall:plan-marshall:phase_handshake` | 1 | drift on `pending_findings_blocking_count` |
| 15:08 | `plan-marshall:build-maven:maven` | 1 | `exit_code: -1`, `duration_seconds: 0` |
| 17:26 | `plan-marshall:tools-integration-ci:ci` | 2 | `unrecognized arguments: --plan-id …` |

The last one is the already-catalogued **verb-scoped `--plan-id`** recurrence
signature: `ci.py`'s top-level choices are `{pr, checks, issue, branch, repo}` and
`--plan-id` is declared on the subcommand, not at the top level. It recurred here
despite being an enumerated signature in the always-loaded agent-behavior rules,
which is the part worth reporting — a documented signature that still fires is
evidence the doc-level guard is not reaching the call site.

The 15:08 `build-maven` row matches the already-recorded 0-second-build signature
(a build reported as failed at `duration_seconds: 0` is a wiring/resolution
failure, not a compilation failure) — see the existing memory entries on worktree
`execute-script.py` absence and post-`integrate_into_main` `--plan-id` resolution.

## Rule

Before any `manage-*` / `ci` call, check the flag's **scope**: a `--plan-id` that
belongs on the subcommand is silently a top-level `unrecognized arguments` rejection
that bypasses the script body entirely. Quote the subcommand and its flags from the
skill's Canonical invocations block, never from surrounding workflow prose.

## Suggested epic action

Consider whether the argparse-rejection signature list is better enforced
structurally (a pre-dispatch validation of the constructed argv against the
script's declared parser) than by a prose checklist that has now demonstrably been
read and still violated.
