# Candidate lesson (handed off from `deployment-configurability`'s local corpus): re_review_on_loopback=false burned a whole loop-back budget on stale-participation churn, quantified

Original lesson `2026-09-23-15-003` (component `api-sheriff`).

## What happened

After a fix push, `automatic-review` recorded `loop_back` twice with: "participation guard: required
bot cuioss-review-bot is participated_stale (issue_comment predates merge candidate); re_review_on_loopback=false
so no re-review trigger posted; recording loop_back". PR-Agent (`cuioss-review-bot`) does not re-review
on push by design (`.github/workflows/pr-agent.yml` triggers only on open/reopen/ready_for_review and
on `/review` comments). With `re_review_on_loopback=false`, each fix push leaves the required bot's
participation stale, and the loop only settles after a manual re-review trigger. Every such loop
re-ran the whole finalize verification chain (quality gate, ci-verify, automatic-review,
sonar-roundtrip) and consumed a loop-back iteration. By the end of this plan's run, all 5 available
iterations were spent with no headroom left — this setting's cost is no longer theoretical.

## Candidate rule

For a required review bot that does not re-review on push, either enable `re_review_on_loopback` or
have the loop-back path post the bot's re-review trigger (e.g. `/review`) itself, so a
`participated_stale` verdict is answered in the same iteration rather than by extra loop-backs. This
repo deliberately kept `re_review_on_loopback: false` (documented rationale in
`doc/development/re-review-on-loopback.adoc`, landed by PLAN-28) contrasting it with
`re_review_on_branch_cleanup: true`; this finding is quantified evidence of that setting's real cost
(burned an entire loop-back budget in one run) worth weighing if the decision is ever revisited.

## Source

`deployment-configurability` PLAN-29 (PR #348), automatic-review step history (firing_count 5, two
`loop_back` outcomes, plan-level `loop_back_iteration` reached 5 of 5). Not fixed in this plan — the
setting's rationale stands per the PLAN-28 decision; recorded so future cost is not treated as a
surprise. A related detail: the automatic-review leaf logs an uninformed "iteration 1" line each time
because it cannot read the persisted loop-back counter — the orchestrator had to correct it manually.
