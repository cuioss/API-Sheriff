# Candidate lesson (handed off from `deployment-configurability`'s local corpus): A new doc deliverable duplicated existing coverage the outline never searched for

Original lesson `2026-09-23-15-001` (component `api-sheriff`).

## What happened

PLAN-29 deliverable 2 planned a new contributor doc
(`doc/development/local-test-environment-caveats.adoc`) about machine-local loopback port-collision
flakiness. The outline neither named nor constrained the new doc against the existing in-depth
coverage in `doc/development/build-gate-discipline.adoc` (which already had a section on the
macOS-local wildcard-ephemeral-bind mechanism and what a contributor does about it). The outline
Q-Gate flagged the duplication risk: execute would likely restate the mechanism and the reading
convention in a second place, where the two could drift or contradict.

## Candidate rule

When an outline deliverable adds a new documentation page on a topic, the outline should search the
existing doc corpus for the same topic and state explicitly: link-not-restate for existing coverage,
how the new content differs from it, and whether the existing page gets a back-link (and if so, list
it in Affected files).

## Source

`deployment-configurability` PLAN-29 (PR #348), Q-Gate finding `32932b` (phase 3-outline, resolution
`fixed`). Fixed at execute (commit `613c380`): the landed doc links to the existing section instead of
restating it, with a dedicated section distinguishing the two mechanisms. Residual: no back-link added
from `build-gate-discipline.adoc` (outside the declared affected-files scope).
