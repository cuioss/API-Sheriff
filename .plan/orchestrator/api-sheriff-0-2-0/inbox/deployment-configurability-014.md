# Candidate lesson (handed off from `deployment-configurability`'s local corpus): A test that pins literal fields stays green when a new field is added, and its own Javadoc claimed otherwise

Original lesson `2026-09-23-07-008` (component `api-sheriff`).

## What happened

`AwaitsTest.pinsTheTierCeilings()` asserted three literal `*_CEILING_SECONDS` values. Adding a
fourth ceiling field to `Awaits` would leave the test green with the new field entirely unpinned. The
sharper half of the finding: the test's own Javadoc claimed it would report a tier added without a
pinned ceiling, which the three literal assertions did not do — the test carried a written guarantee
it did not implement, so a reader checking "is this covered?" got a false yes. The same review pass
found the identical pin-vs-derive shape in a sibling `DocumentedSetsContractTest`, in the same plan.

## Candidate rule

A guard that enumerates members instead of deriving them does not guard the set — it guards the
members that existed when it was written, and fails silently at the moment someone extends the thing
it exists to protect. A Javadoc claim about what a test detects is itself a claim, and nothing checks
it by default. A contract test over a declared inventory should derive the inventory (reflection over
the declaring type, a walk of the schema roots) and assert the derived name->value map; where the
test's Javadoc states what it detects, that statement is part of the contract and must be re-read
when the assertions change.

## Source

`deployment-configurability` PLAN-28 (PR #341), PR review comment `19a92e` (coderabbitai, resolution
`fixed`). Fixed by deriving the ceiling-field inventory from `Awaits` via reflection and asserting
the derived map; the sibling `DocumentedSetsContractTest` was converted the same way in the same
task.
