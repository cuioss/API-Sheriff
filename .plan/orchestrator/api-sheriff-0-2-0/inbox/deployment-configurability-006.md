# Candidate lesson (handed off from `deployment-configurability`'s local corpus): a regression guard pinned to an overdetermined failure passes with the defect reintroduced

Original lesson `2026-09-22-09-001` (component `api-sheriff`, category `improvement`, created
2026-09-22). Note: this lesson's on-disk header was in a non-standard bullet format
(`- id:`/`- component:` rather than `id=`/`component=`) and `manage-lessons get`/`list` could not
parse it — carried here verbatim from the raw file so the content is not lost.

## What happened

PLAN-28 deliverable 2 added an `object` arm to `ConfigLoader.coerce()` and had to keep that arm off
`coerceList`'s per-element path (a leak there would convert a documented, deliberate loud refusal at
array-of-objects pointers into a silent acceptance). The first version of the regression guard drove
`token_validation.issuers` (a real array-of-objects pointer) and asserted the load still failed there.
It passed — and it ALSO passed with the leak deliberately reintroduced, so it proved nothing. The
failure at that pointer was *overdetermined*: `issuers` items require several keys and set
`additionalProperties: false`, so a single-entry object is refused anyway, for a completely different
reason than the one under test.

## Candidate rule

A negative control must be pinned to a site where the correct and defective behaviours produce
DIFFERENT outcomes — not merely a site where the correct behaviour produces the expected one. Before
trusting such a guard, reintroduce the defect and watch it go red. A guard that stays green under the
defect is not a weak guard, it is not a guard at all. When writing a guard against a "must keep
failing" behaviour, ask explicitly: what else could make this fail? If several things could, the site
is overdetermined and the guard is vacuous — choose a site where the defect is the only thing that
changes the outcome, or assert on the discriminating detail (which error, at which pointer) rather
than on failure alone.

## Status: FIXED in the same plan

Moved the guard to `routes[].match.headers`, whose item schema is `required: ["name"]` with
everything else optional — a leaked single-entry object is valid there (binds under the defect, goes
red), while under the correct implementation the element stays a string and the schema refuses it.
Both directions were run to confirm: removing the `object` arm fails exactly the three positive map
tests; forwarding the item type from `coerceList` fails exactly the item-path guard.
