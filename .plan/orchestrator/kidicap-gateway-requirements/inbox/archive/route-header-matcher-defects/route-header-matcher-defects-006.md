# Candidate lesson: PR-Agent re-review trigger timed out twice on a docs-only head

**Source signal**: automated-review (PR-Agent re-review, PR #346)

## What happened

After review-fix pushes, the PR-Agent re-review was requested explicitly (PR-Agent does not re-review on push; `.github/workflows/pr-agent.yml` only fires on opened/reopened/ready_for_review and on `/review` issue comments). On a head whose last commit was docs-only, the re-review trigger/wait timed out twice. The likely cause is that the wait expects a PR-Agent run/comment bound to the new head, and on a docs-only head the workflow either produced no fresh review or was slow to pick up the `/review` command, so the barrier waited to its ceiling.

## Candidate rule

- Treat a PR-Agent re-review on a docs-only delta as optional (or bounded to one attempt) rather than a blocking barrier, since the delta carries no code for PR-Agent to review.
- When the trigger does fire, the wait should key on the `/review` comment's workflow run (via the CI abstraction) and report `not_triggered` distinctly from `timed_out`, so a missing run is not retried blindly.

## Suggested component

plan-marshall:automatic-review / workflow-integration-github (bot_completion, re-review trigger) — possibly with a project-side note in CLAUDE.md Git Workflow step 6.
