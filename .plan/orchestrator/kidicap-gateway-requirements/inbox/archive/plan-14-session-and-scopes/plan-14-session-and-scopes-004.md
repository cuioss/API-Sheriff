# Candidate lesson: CodeRabbit 1-review/hour limit leaves the final commit unreviewed

**Source signal**: automatic-review outcome during finalize of plan-14-session-and-scopes (PR #337).

**Observation**: CodeRabbit's rate limit (one review per hour) meant the final documentation-only commit pushed to PR #337 was never reviewed by CodeRabbit. The required-bot participation check was still satisfied, because CodeRabbit had posted earlier inline reviews on the PR. So "participation satisfied" did not imply "the head commit was reviewed".

**Suggested corrective action**: the review-bot gate should distinguish "bot participated on this PR" from "bot reviewed the current HEAD", at least surfacing it when the last reviewed sha differs from HEAD. Where the unreviewed delta is doc-only this may be acceptable, but it should be an explicit, recorded decision rather than silent.

**Classification**: deferred to orchestrator.
