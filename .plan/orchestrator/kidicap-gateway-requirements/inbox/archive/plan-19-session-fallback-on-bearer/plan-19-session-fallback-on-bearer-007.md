# Candidate lesson: per-deliverable module-tests build ran 6 times at about 11 min each

**Source**: an orchestrator observation from the run. It is not one of the three signal counts, but
it is a cost pattern worth classifying.
**Plan**: plan-19-session-fallback-on-bearer (PR #356, merged as 1fa648d)

## What happened

The phase-5 per-deliverable verification ran the Maven module-tests build
(`test -pl api-sheriff -am`) 6 times. Each run took about 11 minutes, which adds up to roughly 66
minutes of build time. Several of the 7 deliverables were docs-only or touched only a small part
of api-sheriff, but each one still paid for the full module test suite.

## Candidate rule

For a multi-deliverable plan on api-sheriff:
- Do not repeat the module-tests build for a docs-only deliverable. Its footprint cannot change
  the test outcome, which is the same principle as the documentation-only rule in CLAUDE.md.
- Consider combining consecutive code deliverables into one module-tests run, or running targeted
  `-Dtest=` subsets per deliverable and saving the full suite for the end-of-phase sweep.

Classification hint: this might be a plan-marshall verification-step granularity setting
(per-deliverable versus end-of-phase) and not a code lesson. The epic may want to change the
per-deliverable verification profile for this repository.
