# Candidate lesson: installed executor and workflow docs are out of step (script-failure cluster)

**Source**: script-failure-clusters signal.
**Plan**: plan-19-session-fallback-on-bearer (PR #356, merged as 1fa648d)

The run had one more script failure: the automatic-review participation classifier reported
cuioss-review-bot as `participated_stale` when it had not. That one is ALREADY filed as global
lesson `2026-09-24-18-001` and is deliberately NOT repeated here.

## Observed skew

1. **manage-adr scan returns no `duplicate_count`.** The loaded workflow doc reads a
   `duplicate_count` field from `manage-adr scan`, but the installed script's output does not
   contain that field. The consumer therefore had nothing to branch on.
2. **worktree-rebase-to drift probe could not resolve the marketplace anchor.** The rebase-drift
   probe expected a marketplace anchor that is not present in this consumer project (API-Sheriff has
   no `marketplace/bundles/` tree). The probe failed instead of degrading.

## Pattern

Both failures come from the same cause. The workflow text (plugin cache 0.1.1773) and the
installed `.plan/execute-script.py` executor or its scripts were at different revisions. One
failure is also a probe that assumes it runs in the marketplace's own repository and breaks when it
runs in a consumer project.

## Candidate rule / routing

- Upstream (plan-marshall): a workflow that reads a script field should fail visibly when the
  field is absent, not read it as zero or empty. Anchor probes that are specific to the marketplace
  repository should degrade to `not_applicable` in a consumer repository.
- Project side: after a plan-marshall plugin update, run the post-update routine (preflight and
  `manage-config sync-defaults`, or `marshall-steward upgrade`) so that the executor matches the
  cached workflow docs.

Classification hint: this is mostly an upstream plan-marshall defect. The only project-side part
is the post-update hygiene.
