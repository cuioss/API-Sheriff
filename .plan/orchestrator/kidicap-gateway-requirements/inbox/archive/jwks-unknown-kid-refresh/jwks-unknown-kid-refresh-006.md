# Repeated null-check message literal in RetryingJwksLoader raised a CRITICAL Sonar finding on new code

Source record: Sonar finding 62ed86 (sonar-issue, rule `java:S1192`, Sonar severity CRITICAL, type CODE_SMELL, PR #430, `api-sheriff/src/main/java/de/cuioss/sheriff/gateway/auth/RetryingJwksLoader.java` line 248, resolution fixed, fix task TASK-7) of plan `jwks-unknown-kid-refresh`.

Sonar message: define a constant instead of duplicating the literal `"delegate"` 3 times.

`RetryingJwksLoader` called `Objects.requireNonNull(delegateFactory.get(), "delegate")` in three places: the constructor, `runRetry` and `runRefresh`. The third occurrence arrived with this plan's new `runRefresh` path and crossed the rule's threshold.

## Resolution in this run

TASK-7 replaced the three identical calls with one private helper, so the literal occurs once and behaviour is unchanged. Fixed rather than suppressed, per the project's Sonar policy (fix by default; a CRITICAL code smell in new code is not a suppression case).

## Candidate lesson

When a new code path copies an existing guard expression (same call, same message literal) from a sibling method, extract the guard into a helper in the same change. The third copy is the one that trips `java:S1192`, and the pre-push gate does not report it: it surfaced only in the pull request's Sonar analysis, after the push, and cost a follow-up commit.

## Impact

One extra fix commit and CI round on the pull request. No behaviour change.
