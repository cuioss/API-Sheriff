# Candidate lesson: 4-plan q-gate-validation first pass short-circuited on the 3-outline whole-outline hash

- Signal source: Q-Gate (qgate_pending_count), verified in plan decision.log
- Component: plan-marshall:plan-marshall (workflow/q-gate-validation.md, whole-outline short-circuit)
- Suggested category: bug

## What happened

The 3-outline q-gate-validation pass wrote work/deliverable-hashes.toon (07:52:54). The first 4-plan
q-gate-validation pass (decision.log 08:11:02) logged
`whole-outline-short-circuit: hash(whole_outline)==stored_whole_outline_hash (fe98daef...); skipping Step 4 wholesale
for this 4-plan(module-mapping-validator,scope-criterion-validator) pass, re-emitting prior qgate_pending_count`
and reported "9 passed, 0 flagged".

The orchestrator rejected it (08:11:38, WARNING): planning-outline.md documents that the FIRST pass of a phase is
never content-gated; the 3-outline pass never ran the module-mapping / scope-criterion validators; and finding 682354
was resolved between the passes. A re-dispatch with the short-circuit disabled ran both validators for real (08:18).

## Why it matters

The hash key is phase-agnostic and validator-set-agnostic, so a hash stored by one phase's validator set vouches for a
different phase's validators that never ran against the outline. The result was a green verdict with zero validators
executed - a vacuous pass reported as a real one.

## Suggested corrective rule

Key the stored whole-outline hash by (phase, validator set), or refuse the short-circuit on the first pass of each
phase, so the documented "first pass is never content-gated" contract is enforced in code rather than caught by the
orchestrator.
