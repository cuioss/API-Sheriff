# Candidate lesson: ci-verify classified a test failure as ci_policy_failure because the build-job detector keys on a workflow-name token

- Signal source: ci-verify loop-back (triage record, decision.log 15:28:21) plus orchestrator observation
- Component: plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize (ci-verify build-job classification) / plan-marshall:plan-marshall (workflow/verification-feedback.md)
- Suggested category: bug

## What happened

Red CI at a4cbffd: job `build (25)` failed on GatewayEdgePipelineTest.metersDisallowedVerbUnderItsRoute, `build (26)`
was cancelled by fail-fast. The ci-verify triage (decision.log 15:28:21) records: "ci_verify classified the build (25)
test failure as ci_policy_failure because workflow_name 'Maven Build' holds no canonical build token."

Orchestrator additionally observed that verification-feedback (plan-marshall 0.1.1729) has no producer mode for the
ci-verify-policy / ci-verify-cancelled finding classes, so the misclassified findings had to be routed by hand
(orchestrator-reported; not independently visible in the plan logs).

## Why it matters

A plain unit-test failure was presented as a CI policy failure. The detector depends on the repository's workflow
naming (cuioss uses "Maven Build"), so every repo whose build workflow lacks the canonical token gets the wrong class,
and with no producer mode for the policy/cancelled classes the loop-back cannot turn them into fix tasks automatically.

## Suggested corrective rule

Classify build-vs-policy failures from the job's observable result (failed test / compile step, surefire report
artifacts) or from a configurable build-workflow name in marshal.json, not from a hard-coded name token; and give
verification-feedback a producer mode for every finding class ci-verify can emit.
