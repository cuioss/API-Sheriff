# Candidate lesson: architecture --plan-id placed after the subcommand verb (argparse rejection)

- Signal source: script-failure cluster 1 of 2 (work.log 09:28:24, [ERROR] script_failure)
- Component: plan-marshall:manage-architecture (architecture.py top-level flags) / plan-marshall:phase-5-execute (caller)
- Suggested category: anti-pattern

## What happened

During phase-5-execute re-entry a call to `plan-marshall:manage-architecture:architecture` failed with exit_code=2,
failure_kind=argparse_rejection:
`architecture.py: error: unrecognized arguments: --plan-id plan-16-application-portal`
`note: --plan-id is a top-level flag and belongs BEFORE ...` (the verb).

Correction to the orchestrator's summary: the logged flag was `--plan-id`, not `--project-dir`; both are top-level
router flags on architecture.py (`[--project-dir PROJECT_DIR] [--plan-id PLAN_ID] {verb} ...`), so the fix is the same.

## Why it matters

This is the known "router-scoped --plan-id/--project-dir placed AFTER the verb" recurrence signature. It recurs because
most manage-* scripts declare --plan-id on the subcommand, so callers append it by rote.

## Suggested corrective rule

For architecture.py, --plan-id / --project-dir go BEFORE the verb:
`architecture --plan-id {plan_id} {verb} ...`. Consider having the router accept the flag after the verb as well (or
auto-relocate it), since the error message already knows the correct position.
