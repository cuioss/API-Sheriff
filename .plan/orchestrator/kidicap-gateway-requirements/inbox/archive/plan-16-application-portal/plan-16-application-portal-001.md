# Candidate lesson: operator outline answers that match the recommended default are not persisted into solution_outline.md

- Signal source: orchestrator observation, verified in plan decision.log
- Component: plan-marshall:phase-3-outline (outline_prompt answer persistence) / plan-marshall:plan-marshall (orchestrator re-dispatch rule)
- Suggested category: bug

## What happened

At the 3-outline review the operator answered two outline questions (decision.log 07:48:55):
q1 portal CSP = hardened (`default-src 'self'; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'`),
q2 username always shown. The orchestrator recorded "Both match the outline's recommended defaults - no outline re-dispatch needed".

The answer text never reached solution_outline.md. TASK-7 then shipped `PORTAL_CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY = "default-src 'self'"`
(the weaker value). The orchestrator caught the drift only at TASK-7 review (decision.log 08:52:33, WARNING
"Operator-decision drift") and re-dispatched envelope 2 to correct the constant, Javadoc and tests within TASK-8.

## Why it matters

"Matches the recommended default" was treated as "already in the outline", but the outline carried the question and
its recommendation as a question, not as a settled decision in the deliverable body. Execution agents read the
deliverable text, not the answered prompt. A security-relevant operator decision silently degraded.

## Suggested corrective rule

Every operator answer to an outline_prompt must be persisted into solution_outline.md (deliverable text and/or a
settled-decisions section) regardless of whether it equals the recommended default; skipping the outline re-dispatch
is only safe once the answer is written. Consider a mechanical check that every answered outline question id has a
matching settled-decision entry before phase-4-plan starts.
